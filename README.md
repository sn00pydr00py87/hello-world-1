# hello-world-1
This time i've initialised the repository with a README
Hi there, I'm Manoj and I was born in October, 1978 so that makes me a Libra though I don't really believe in horoscropes if truth be told.


This site was put together quickly to allow you see my existing skillset and knowledge, as well as get an idea of my proficiency in the various areas of Web Development.


Now, I really enjoy crafting websites, especialy responsive ones which serve their purpose for an end user and client. I also find that the more you design and build web pages, the more new problems and challenges await and thus, consequently, once these have been overcome one gains invaluable experience and of course knowledge. This is the whole reason to why I like making web based solutions, from a simple brouchure website to a multi-user booking application.
